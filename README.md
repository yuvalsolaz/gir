# G I R  Geographical Information Retrieval

Implementation for geocoding model 


TODO: 
1. label 4 cube sides (discard poles)
2. validation benchmark  
3. geo visualization for inference: notebook with input text and put cell on map  
4. train on tweeter data
5. train on wiki all items 
6. beam search for output sequence 
7. metric: - hierarchy classification or numeric diff (right pad with zero)  
8. replace t5-small to base/large pretrained model after tunings
9. load gt labels as strings

length_penalty (float, optional, defaults to 1.0) â€” Exponential penalty to the length. 1.0 means that the beam score is penalized by the sequence length. 0.0 means no penalty. Set to values < 0.0 in order to encourage the model to generate longer sequences, to a value > 0.0 in order to encourage the model to produce shorter sequences.
