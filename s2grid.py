"""
This example shows how to add spatial data to an information retrieval
system.  Such systems work by converting documents into a collection of
"index terms" (e.g., representing words or phrases), and then building an
"inverted index" that maps each term to a list of documents (and document
positions) where that term occurs.
This example shows how to convert spatial data into index terms, which can
then be indexed along with the other document information.
This is a port of the C++ term_index.cc example for the Python API.
